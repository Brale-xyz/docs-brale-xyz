  subheading="Accounts represent your customers. When you register an account with Brale, we conduct KYB checks to ensure secure and compliant fund transfers between your customers' banks accounts and wallets."
/>

To KYB and approve an account, we collect key details such as business name and EIN. For more information, see our [Compliance Requirements](/docs/coverage/compliance-requirements). If additional details are required, we will notify you with the necessary steps to complete KYB.

Customers can also self onboard at https://app.brale.xyz/signup.

      "country": "USA"
    }
  }
}
```

## Account Status

Brale will review the Account and return a `status` field denoting the customer's KYB status. If the customer is in a pending status, you will need to wait for the customer to be verified before creating or linking addresses or bank accounts.

```shell
GET https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/:id
```

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "status": "complete",
  "business_name": "ABC Company Inc"
  //	...
}
```

### Account Statuses

| Value      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`  | KYB is in progress                           |
| `complete` | KYB is completed and the account is approved |
| `rejected` | The account's KYB was rejected               |

## Using Account ID in every request

All resources in the Brale API (Addresses, Financial Institutions, Transfers, Automations, etc.) are scoped to specific accounts. Supply the ID in the path, never in the body.

:::info[Path Rule]

Every endpoint that contains `{account_id}` must be called by including the account ID in the path.
E.g. `GET https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/2Js1YFqlfxgNqC2KTPEjrWIwKU7/addresses`. Do not send the account ID in the body or query string.
