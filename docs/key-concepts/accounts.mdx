### Presenting the Brale End-User Agreement

Partners must show the exact Brale End-User Agreement (EUA) to their end users before calling `POST` `/accounts` and capture consent. The most recent version is hosted at <ExternalLink href="https://brale.xyz/legal/end-user-agreement" title="View Brale End-User Agreement">https://brale.xyz/legal/end-user-agreement</ExternalLink>.

## Account Status

Brale will review the Account and return a `status` field denoting the customer's KYB status. If the customer is in a pending status, you will need to wait for the customer to be verified before creating or linking addresses or bank accounts.

<HTTPMethod method="GET" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/:id" />

```json title="Response"
{
  "id": "2VcUIIsgARwVbEGlIYbhg6fGG57",
  "name": "ABC Company",
  "status": "pending",
  "created": "2023-09-19T14:46:20"
}
```

### Account Statuses

| Value      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`  | KYB is in progress                           |
| `complete` | KYB is completed and the account is approved |
| `rejected` | The account's KYB was rejected               |

## Using Account ID in every request

All resources in the Brale API (Addresses, Financial Institutions, Transfers, Automations, etc.) are scoped to specific accounts. Supply the ID in the path, never in the body.

:::info[Path Rule]

Every endpoint that contains `{account_id}` must be called by including the account ID in the path.
E.g. `GET` `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/2Js1YFqlfxgNqC2KTPEjrWIwKU7/addresses`. Do not send the account ID in the body or query string.
