# Accounts

Accounts represent your customers. When you register an account with Brale, we conduct KYB checks to ensure secure and compliant fund transfers between your customers' banks accounts and wallets.

To KYB and approve an account, we collect key details such as business name and EIN. For more information, see our [Compliance Requirements](https://docs.brale.xyz/docs/compliance-requirements). If additional details are required, we will notify you with the necessary steps to complete KYB.

:::note
Accounts can also be onboarded by directing your customers to signup for Brale directly at https://app.brale.xyz/signup.

## Account Status

Brale will review the Account and return a `status` field denoting the customer's KYB status. If the customer is in a pending status, you will need to wait for the customer to be verified before creating or linking addresses or bank accounts.

Some Accounts may require additional documentation for verification, which are returned in `kyb_requirements`.
