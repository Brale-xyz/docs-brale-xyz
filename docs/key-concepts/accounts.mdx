<p class="intro-subheading">
Accounts are represented by account_ids, which are assigned to KYB’d (business) entities. If you have an API Key and Secret, your application has its own account_id. You can also create additional account_ids for your business clients.

Each account_id is associated with one or more custodial (type=internal) onchain wallets, which are represented by address_ids. An account_id may also be linked to a financial_institution_id to enable first-party fiat funding for mints and redemptions.

The account_id is used in the request URL across many Brale API endpoints to scope the request to a specific application or client. 
</p>

To KYB and approve an account, we collect key details such as business name and EIN. For more information, see our Compliance Requirements. If additional details are required, we will notify you with the necessary steps to complete KYB.

## Common Errors when creating Accounts

| HTTP Status | Code                   | Message                                               | Potential Cause                     | Fix                     |

| `422`       | `Unprocessable Entity` | Invalid format for business or controller information | Phone number area code is not valid | Include valid area code |

## Account Status

Brale will review the Account and return a `status` field denoting the customer's KYB status. If the customer is in a pending status, you will need to wait for the customer to be verified before creating or linking addresses or bank accounts.

<HTTPMethod method="GET" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/:id" />

```json title="Response"
{
  "id": "2VcUIIsgARwVbEGlIYbhg6fGG57",
  "name": "ABC Company",
  "status": "pending",
  "created": "2023-09-19T14:46:20"
}
```

### Account Statuses

| Value      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`  | KYB is in progress                           |
| `complete` | KYB is completed and the account is approved |
| `rejected` | The account's KYB was rejected               |

## Using Account ID in every request

All resources in the Brale API (Addresses, Financial Institutions, Transfers, Automations, etc.) are scoped to specific accounts. Supply the ID in the path, never in the body.

:::info[Path Rule]

Every endpoint that contains `{account_id}` must be called by including the account ID in the path.
E.g. `GET` `https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/2Js1YFqlfxgNqC2KTPEjrWIwKU7/addresses`. Do not send the account ID in the body or query string.
