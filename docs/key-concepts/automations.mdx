<Intro
  heading="Automations"
  subheading="Automations allow businesses to set up automatic onramps, offramps, or stablecoin swaps that are triggered upon receiving fundsâ€”without requiring a manual transfer request."
/>

## Common Automation Flows

- **Fiat to Stablecoin (Onramp)** - Automatically mints stablecoins when a fiat deposit is received.
- **Stablecoin to Fiat (Offramp)** - Automatically converts stablecoins to fiat and withdraws to a bank account. _(Coming soon)_
- **Stablecoin to Stablecoin (Swap)** - Automatically swaps one stablecoin for another. _(Coming soon)_

## Onramp Automation

Automations provide a unique account number and routing number for wire transfers and ACH deposits. When funds are received, stablecoins are automatically minted to a pre-defined wallet address. Businesses can use automations to direct unique pre-funding coordinates to their customers, which mint stablecoins in a customer's wallet.

## Creating an Automation
