# Automations

Automations allow businesses to set up automatic onramps, offramps, or stablecoin swaps that are triggered upon receiving fundsâ€”without requiring a manual transfer request.

## Common Automation Flows

- **Fiat to Stablecoin (Onramp)**: Automatically mints stablecoins when a fiat deposit is received.
- **Stablecoin to Fiat (Offramp)**: Automatically converts stablecoins to fiat and withdraws to a bank account.
- **Stablecoin to Stablecoin (Swap)**: Automatically swaps one stablecoin for another.

:::note
Automations can also be created in the Brale Dashboard on the Automations tab.

## Onramp Automations

Automations provide a unique account number and routing number for wire transfers and ACH deposits. When funds are received, stablecoins are automatically minted to a pre-defined wallet address. Businesses can use automations to direct unique pre-funding coordinates to their customers, which mint stablecoins in a customer's wallet.

## Creating an Automations
