Brale distinguishes between internal and external addresses:

- Internal addresses – Custodial addresses managed by Brale on behalf of customers.
- External addresses (EOAs) – Non-custodial addresses controlled by users outside of Brale.

Whether internal or external, all addresses possess:

- `name` - A user-friendly label to identify the wallet.
- `address` - The unique wallet address on a specific blockchain (EVM, Solana, etc.).
- `transfer_types` - The blockchains the wallet supports. See Supported Chains for the full list. Each address is associated with only one blockchain environment (e.g., Solana, EVM).

## Custodial (Internal) Addresses

Brale provides custodial wallets that allow businesses to securely hold and transfer stablecoins on behalf of themselves or their customers. Custodial addresses support all supported blockchains.

When your customer's Account is onboarded, Brale automatically generates internal custodial addresses on all supported blockchains. You do not need to create them manually.
