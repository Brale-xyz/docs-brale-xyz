<p class="intro-subheading">
  Addresses are on-chain wallet addresses that can send and receive stablecoins as well as off-chain
  addresses that can send and receive US fiat.
</p>

Brale distinguishes between internal and external addresses:

- **Internal addresses** - Custodial addresses managed by Brale on behalf of customers.
- **External addresses (EOAs)** - Non-custodial addresses controlled by users outside of Brale.
- **External addresses** `NEW` - Addresses associated with an ACH `transfer_type` that power [2nd & 3rd Party Transfers](/guides/2nd-and-3rd-party-transfers).
  - To learn more and see how this can benefit your business, schedule a meeting to <ExternalLink href="https://brale.xyz/contact" title="Schedule a meeting with Brale">talk to sales</ExternalLink>.

Whether internal or external, all addresses possess:

- `name`: A user-friendly label to identify the address.
- `transfer_types`: The supported `transfer_types` of the address.

## Custodial (Internal) Addresses

Brale provides custodial wallets that allow businesses to securely hold and transfer stablecoins on behalf of themselves or their customers. Custodial addresses support all supported blockchains.

When your customer's Account is onboarded, Brale automatically generates internal custodial addresses on all supported blockchains. You do not need to create them manually.

## Non-Custodial (External) Addresses

Linking external addresses enable users to deposit stablecoins into or withdraw stablecoins from their custodial addresses as well as mint stablecoins into or redeem stablecoins from their custodial addresses.
