<p class="intro-subheading">
  Addresses are represented by an `address_id`, which uniquely identifies a wallet or account for a
  specific `transfer_type`.
</p>

An `address_id` can represent either an onchain or offchain destination (e.g. blockchain wallet, bank account, RTP endpoint), depending on the `transfer_type`.

The `address_id` is commonly used in the Brale API as the source or destination of a transfer.

Brale distinguishes between internal and external addresses using the type field:

- `type`: `internal` - An `address_id` associated with wallets managed by Brale on behalf of you or your customers.
- `type`: `external` - An `address_id` managed outside of Brale's infrastructure (e.g., user-owned wallet or external account).

Whether internal or external, all addresses possess:

- `name`: A user-friendly label to identify the address.
- `transfer_types`: The supported `transfer_types` of the address.

## Custodial (Internal) Addresses

Brale provides custodial wallets that allow businesses to securely hold and transfer stablecoins on behalf of themselves or their customers. Custodial addresses support all supported blockchains.

When your customer's Account is onboarded, Brale automatically generates internal custodial addresses on all supported blockchains. You do not need to create them manually.

## Non-Custodial (External) Addresses

Linking external addresses enable users to deposit stablecoins into or withdraw stablecoins from their custodial addresses as well as mint stablecoins into or redeem stablecoins from their custodial addresses.

<HTTPMethod method="POST" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/addresses/external" />

### Non-Custodial (External) Address for Blockchain Supported Chains

### Filtering Addresses
