## Create Financial Institutions through Plaid

:::info[Coming Soon]
Creating Financial Institutions through Plaid is not yet supported. To learn more, please reach out to our team.
:::

This guide walks you through how to enable your customers to securely link their bank accounts via Plaid. After linking, the new Financial Institutions can be used for ACH pulls.

### Overview of the Flow

1. Request a Plaid Link Token from Brale.
2. Initialize Plaid Link in your front-end using the `link_token`.
3. Plaid returns a `public_token` once the user has successfully linked their account.
4. Exchange the `public_token` with Brale to finalize the linking process.
5. Fetch the newly created Financial Institutions for the end user, then proceed with transfers, withdrawals, etc.

### Request a Plaid Link Token

<HTTPMethod method="POST" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/financial_institution/plaid_link_token" />

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "link_token": "link_token_XYZ",
  "expires_at": "2025-03-23T03:22:34.086Z",
  "exchange_callback_url": "https://api.brale.xyz/exchange_public_token/{unique-id}"
}
```

| Parameters              | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link_token`            | The token you will use to launch Plaid Link in your front-end or mobile app.       |
| `expires_at`            | Time at which the `link_token` will no longer be valid.                            |
| `exchange_callback_url` | The endpoint to which you should send the `public_token` to finalize the exchange. |

### Render the Plaid Link SDK

In your front-end, initialize Plaid Link using the link_token you received.

For production apps, it's recommended you send the public_token to your own backend (over HTTPS), and then have your backend call our exchange endpoint. That way, you avoid exposing your own platform API keys in the browser.

### Exchange the Public Token

Once the user completes linking, you'll receive a `public_token`. You must exchange it for permanent access tokens and link information.

```
POST https://api.brale.xyz/financial_institution/exchange_public_token
```

```json title="Request" showLineNumbers
{
  "public_token": "public_token_XYZ"
}
```

After this call completes, our system retrieves the linked bank accounts and creates External Accounts for each account the user selected.

### Check for Newly Created Financial Institutions

Shortly after exchanging the public token, the userâ€™s bank accounts are idempotently created as Financial Institutions which you can query.

<HTTPMethod method="GET" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/financial_institutions/:id" />

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "Business Checking Account",
  "transfer_type": ["ACH", "Wire"],
  "metadata": {
    "nickname": "Payroll Account",
    "created_by": "InternalUser123"
  },
  "bank_details": {
    "owner": "Jane Doe",
    "account_number": "1234567890",
    "routing_number": "987654321",
    "name": "Example Bank",
    "address": {
      "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
      "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "90001",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "account_type": "checking"
  }
}
```

At this point, you can initiate ACH pulls or other transactions using these new Financial Institutions.
