<Intro
  heading="Fiat to Stablecoin (Onramp)"
  subheading="Brale makes it easy for you and your customers to convert USD into stablecoins via wire transfer or ACH."
/>

There are two ways to onramp to stablecoins through the Brale API:

- Submit a [Transfer](/docs/key-concepts/transfers) request with a source value_type of wire or ACH
- Create an Automation, which automatically mints stablecoins to a pre-configured destination wallet when funds are received (Automatic Onramp)

Businesses can also onramp directly via the Brale Dashboard, and individuals can onramp through Brale.io.

## Fiat to Stablecoin via Wire

Here is an example of onramping to your own stablecoin (YSBC) via wire transfer by calling the Transfers endpoint with the source `transfer_type` of `wire`.

<HTTPMethod method="POST" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers" />

```json title="Request" showLineNumbers
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "value_type": "usd",
    "transfer_type": "wire"
  },
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "d7bd28e4-93e6-4313-880c-ab9178eacd3b",
    "value_type": "ysbc",
    "transfer_type": "solana"
  }
}
```

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "transfer_123",
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "transfer_type": "wire",
    "value_type": "usd"
  },
  "destination": {
    "transfer_type": "polygon",
    "value_type": "ysbc",
    "address_id": "d7bd28e4-93e6-4313-880c-ab9178eacd3b"
  },
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    // ...Brale bank details
  }
}
```

Initially, the status of the transfer will be `pending`. Once Brale receives the funds at the bank account provided in `source_deposit_instructions` the stablecoins will immediately be minted to the destination wallet.

### Fetching Transfers

Query a transfer that has been created through:

<HTTPMethod method="GET" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers/:id" />

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": {
    "value": "1",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-02-05T19:39:14.316Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-02-05T19:39:14.316Z",
  "source": {
    "value_type": "usd",
    "transfer_type": "wire"
  },
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "string",
    "value_type": "ysbc",
    "transfer_type": "polygon"
  },
  "gasFee": "0.01"
}
```

## Fiat to Stablecoin Automation (Automatic Onramp)

Automations provide a unique account number and routing number that accepts wire transfers and ACH deposits, and automatically mints stablecoins to a pre-defined wallet address. Businesses can use automations to direct unique pre-funding coordinates to their customers, which mint stablecoins in customers' wallets.

Here is an example of onramping to your own stablecoin (YSBC) via wire transfer by creating a fiat-to-stablecoin automation.

<HTTPMethod method="POST" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/automations" />

```json title="Request" showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "XYZ Automation",
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "d7bd28e4-93e6-4313-880c-ab9178eacd3b",
    "value_type": "ysbc",
    "transfer_type": "Solana"
  }
}
```

The response will return the unique account number and routing number to direct to your customer.

```json title="Response" showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "XYZ Onramp",
  "status": "complete",
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    "bank_beneficiary_name": "Jane Business",
    "bank_name": "Example Bank",
    "bank_address": "456 Commerce St., Des Moines, IA 50309",
    "bank_beneficiary": "XYZ Holdings LLC",
    "bank_account_number": "123456789",
    "bank_routing_number": "87654321"
  },
  "destination": {
    "address_id": "0xDEADBEEF",
    "value_type": "YSBC",
    "transfer_type": "Solana"
  }
}
```
