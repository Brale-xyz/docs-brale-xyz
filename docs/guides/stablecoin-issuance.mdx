<Intro heading="Stablecoin Issuance" />

## Overview

Brale enables businesses to create their own stablecoins in minutes and earn treasury revenue on underlying reserves, managed by Brale. Stablecoins are fully backed by cash, cash equivalents, and short-duration U.S. treasuries held in segregated accounts.

Brale shares 90% of treasury revenue with businesses monthly.

Once issued, stablecoins are made available to your customers via the API (see [Transfers](/key-concepts/transfers), [Automations](/key-concepts/automations)) and to other distributors (OTCs, Market Makers, Custodians, etc.)

## Why create your own stablecoin

Issuance allows businesses to benefit from the treasury economics of a stablecoin and provides an additional degree of control not available with third-party stablecoins:

- **Treasury Revenue**: Earn treasury revenue on funds at rest. This allows fintechs to monetize user deposits, and for emerging ecosystems and app chains to monetize all digital dollars on their network.
- **Free on and off ramps**: Once issued, your stablecoin is available to your customers to acquire via USD or USDC with $0 fees. Make your stablecoin available via the Brale Dashboard, by embedding into your application using the Brale API, or by embedding the Brale.io onramp widget.
- **Branded**: Create branded, cohesive product experiences leveraging the trust and familiarity of your brand.
- **Issue Natively on Emerging Blockchains**: Issue a native-fiat backed stablecoin on your L1 / L2 / Appchain.

## How to create a stablecoin

Issue natively on 14+ blockchains in less than 10 minutes. Below is a live walkthrough.

## How it works

1. Launch your stablecoin through the Brale dashboard by choosing your name, ticker symbol, logo, and chain(s).
2. The stablecoin will be immediately listed on Brale's exchange and can be acquired via USD or USDC.
3. Brale manages the regulated reserves.
4. Brale shares treasury revenue with you monthly.

## Cross Chain Swaps

Stablecoins are issued natively on each chain and can be swapped 1:1 between chains at any time. Stablecoins are burned on the source chain, and minted on the destination chain. Brale does not use any wrapping or locking mechanism - all stablecoins are issued natively and enforce natural supply.
