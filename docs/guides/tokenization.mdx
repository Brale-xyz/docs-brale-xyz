# Tokenization

Brale enables businesses to issue, manage, and custody tokens on all supported blockchains.

Tokenization makes it easy to manage on-chain supply of digital assets against off-chain reserves (or points, goods and services, etc.) across multiple blockchains. This also enables local currency stablecoins with existing banking relationships to easily manage on-chain operations with their team, or to expand their assets to additional blockchains without development effort.

To get access to the Tokenization API, reach out to our team at [support@brale.xyz](mailto:support@brale.xyz).

## Issue Tokens

Issue new tokens on all supported blockchains through the Brale Dashboard.
