# Stablecoin to Fiat (Offramp)

Brale makes it easy for you and your customers to convert stablecoins into USD via wire transfer or ACH.

In order to submit a stablecoin-to-fiat transaction, first you need to:

- Create an [Account](/docs/concepts/accounts) respresenting your customer
- Create a [Financial Institution](/docs/concepts/financial-institutions) which is your customer's bank account where Brale will deposit USD
- Deposit stablecoins to a Brale custodial address (address with type `internal`)

## Link a Financial Institution to your customer's Account

You can add financial institutions in two ways:

1. Financial Institutions API
2. Plaid (_coming soon_)

Here is an example of directly adding a financial institution.

### Request

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/financialinstitution/externals`

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "Company ABC Checking",
  "transfer_type": ["Ach", "Wire"],
  "metadata": {
    "nickname": "Payroll Account",
    "createdBy": "InternalUser123"
  },
  "bankDetails": {
    "owner": "John Doe",
    "accountNumber": "1234567890",
    "routingNumber": "987654321",
    "name": "Bank Corp",
    "address": {
      "streetLine1": "123 Mockingbird Lane",
      "streetLine2": "Apt 4B",
      "city": "Metropolis",
      "state": "NY",
      "zip": "10001",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "accountType": "checking"
  }
}
```

### Response

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "2AbCdEfGHiJkLmN0pQrStUvWxYz"
}
```

## Stablecoin to USD via Wire

Once your customer has a Financial Institution and stablecoins are held in a Brale controlled address, you can submit a Transfer request with the destination of the financial institution.

### Request

**POST** `https://api.brale.xyz/transfer`

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "address_id": "string",
    "value_type": "YSBC",
    "transfer_type": "Solana"
  },
  "destination": {
    "financial_institution_id": "2AbCdEfGHiJkLmN0pQrStUvWxYz",
    "value_type": "USD",
    "transfer_type": "wire",
    "memo": "BRL*Transaction"
  }
}
```

Brale will burn the stablecoins from the Source Address immediately, and then transfer USD to the destination bank account.

## Stablecoin to MXN via SPEI

### Request

    "address_id": "string",
    "value_type": "USDC",
    "transfer_type": "solana"
  },
  "destination": {

    "transfer_type": "spei"
  }
