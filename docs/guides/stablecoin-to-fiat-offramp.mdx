<p class="intro-subheading">
  Brale makes it easy for you and your customers to convert stablecoins into USD via wire transfer
  or ACH.
</p>

In order to submit a stablecoin-to-fiat transaction, first you need to:

- Create an [Account](/key-concepts/accounts) respresenting your customer
- Create a [Financial Institution](/key-concepts/financial-institutions) which is your customer's bank account where Brale will deposit USD
- Deposit stablecoins to a Brale custodial address (address with type `internal`)

## Link a Financial Institution to your customer's Account

You can add financial institutions in two ways:

1. Financial Institutions API
2. Plaid (coming soon)

Here is an example of directly adding a financial institution.

<HTTPMethod
  method="POST"
  endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/financial-institutions/external"
/>

```json title="Request"
{
  "owner": "Jane Doe",
  "account_number": "1234567890",
  "routing_number": "987654321",
  "name": "Example Bank",
  "beneficiary_address": {
    "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
    "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "90001"
  },
  "bank_address": {
    "street_line_1": "100 Example St",
    "street_line_2": "Suite 500",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "90001"
  },
  "account_type": "checking"
}
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "id": "2O0bbQgbSL52PktkiTgv3yq3hiB",
  "name": "Example Bank",
  "status": "active",
  "created": "2023-04-05T13:15:17.273102Z",
  "routingNumber": "987654321"
}
```

## Stablecoin to USD via Wire

Once your customer has a Financial Institution and stablecoins are held in a Brale controlled address, you can submit a Transfer request with the destination of the financial institution.

<HTTPMethod method="POST" endpoint="https://api.brale.xyz/accounts/account_id/transfers" />

```json title="Request"
{
  "amount": {
    "value": "100",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "source": {
    "address_id": "2VcUIonJeVQzFoBuC7LdFT0dRe4",
    "value_type": "YSBC",
    "transfer_type": "Solana"
  },
  "destination": {
    "financial_institution_id": "2AbCdEfGHiJkLmN0pQrStUvWxYz",
    "value_type": "USD",
    "transfer_type": "wire"
  }
}
```

Brale will burn the stablecoins from the Source Address immediately, and then transfer USD to the destination bank account.
