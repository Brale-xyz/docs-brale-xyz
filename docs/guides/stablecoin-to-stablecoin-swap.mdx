# Stablecoin to Stablecoin (Swap)

Brale makes it easy to swap between stablecoins, and to swap stablecoins between blockchains. See [Supported Stablecoins and Blockchains](/docs/coverage/stablecoins-and-blockchains) for the full list.

## Swap Your Stablecoin Cross Chain

Stablecoins are issued natively on each chain and can be swapped 1:1 between chains at any time. Stablecoins are burned on the source chain, and minted on the destination chain.

**Swap from Solana to Base**
